### Project Description
[2-3 lines about what your project does]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Transform your static resume into an AI-generated talking avatar video. Upload a resume and a photo, and boom ‚Äî your digital twin introduces you in style.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Resumes are boring. HRs don‚Äôt like reading. We solve the problem of ‚Äúpaper not speaking.‚Äù Because everyone wants their r√©sum√© to talk... right?

## Technical Details
