## 📘 Project Description

Transform your static resume into an AI-generated talking avatar video. Upload a resume and a photo, and boom — your digital twin introduces you in style.

## 🚫 The Problem (that doesn’t exist)

Resumes are boring. HRs don’t like reading. We solve the problem of “paper not speaking.” Because everyone wants their résumé to talk... right?

## ✅ The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Using generative AI, we extract your career highlights from a PDF, synthesize speech, and deepfake your face onto an avatar that introduces you like a tech-savvy influencer at a TED Talk.
